Fitting benchmarks
===================


Benchmarks with :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2`
#######################################


Experimental photoemission band mapping data for tungsten diselenide (:math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2`) are obtained from either experiment [1] or model-based synthesis [2]. Example scripts are included under the `/benchmarks folder <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/tree/master/benchmarks>`_ of the package.

1. ``01_WSe2_Kpoint.py`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/01_WSe2_Kpoint.py>`_)

Contains a full script with the option to run on the command line for batch fitting photoemission data around the :math:`K` point of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2`. The following bash scripts contain numerical experiments for tuning the energy shift hyperparameters associated with each energy band.

* ``WSe2_Kpoint_recon_02.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_Kpoint_recon_02.sh>`_) -- energy shift hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 1-2 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_Kpoint_recon_04.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_Kpoint_recon_04.sh>`_) -- energy shift hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 3-4 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_Kpoint_recon_08.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_Kpoint_recon_08.sh>`_) -- energy shift hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 5-8 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_Kpoint_recon_14.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_Kpoint_recon_14.sh>`_) -- energy shift hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 9-14 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_computing_params_tuning.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_computing_params_tuning.sh>`_) -- Tuning the task distribution parameters in parallelization (used in [3])


2. ``02_WSe2_Mpoint.py`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/02_WSe2_Mpoint.py>`_)

Contains a full script with the option to run on the command line for batch fitting photoemission data around the :math:`M` point of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2`.


3. ``03_WSe2_hsymline.py`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/03_WSe2_hsymline.py>`_)

Contains a full script with the option to run on the command line for batch fitting photoemission data around the high-symmetry line (HSL) of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2`. The following bash scripts contain numerical experiments for tuning the energy shift hyperparameters associated with each energy band.

* ``WSe2_hsymline_recon_02.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_hsymline_recon_02.sh>`_) -- hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 1-2 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_hsymline_recon_04.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_hsymline_recon_04.sh>`_) -- hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 3-4 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_hsymline_recon_08.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_hsymline_recon_08.sh>`_) -- hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 5-8 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range

* ``WSe2_hsymline_recon_14.sh`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/WSe2_hsymline_recon_14.sh>`_) -- hyperparameter tuning for reconstructing energy band 9-14 of :math:`\mathrm{WSe}_2` within the corresponding energy range


How to use
##########

To execute the script on a local computer, one needs to download the data from the repository `pesarxiv <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesarxiv>`_. After updating the file address within the Python scripts, they can be executed directly on the command line. For the bash scripts, one needs to change the ``PYTHONPATH`` global parameter to the corresponding address on the local computer before execution.
