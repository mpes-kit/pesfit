Batch fitting benchmark -- powder electron diffraction
======================================================


Outline
########


The aim of the benchmark is to fit a 3D dataset of fluence and time-dependent diffraction patterns from polycrystalline platinum (:math:`\mathrm{Pt}`) [1,2]. Each diffraction pattern is a 1D intensity profile composed of more than 10 diffraction peaks.

1. ``04_Pt_Ediff.py`` (`link <https://github.com/mpes-kit/pesfit/blob/master/benchmarks/04_Pt_Ediff.py>`_)

Contains a full script with the option to run on the command line for batch fitting the powder electron diffraction data of polycrystalline :math:`\mathrm{Pt}`.
